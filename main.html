         <p class='p1'><strong>Satella </strong>(サテラ) is the Witch of Envy responsible for the Great Calamity 
            400 years ago who is currently sealed underneath the Pleiades Watchtower. In reality, 
            the Witch of Envy is a separate personality, born when she took in incompatible Witch Factors. 
            Satella formally debuted in Arc 4 as a supporting character, whilst the Witch serves as an overarching 
            antagonist throughout the series.</p>

            <p class='p2'>She is a girl with long silver hair, and purple blue eyes.
                <em>In the first picture is her in her black cloack from Echidna's tea party.</em>
                Whilst the other picture was her normally.  <strong>Most people get 
                her confused with Emilia as they look alike. Both Emilia and Satalla 
                are half elves and Satalla has a gold and black clothes with a purple outline
                and shadows timed to her heartbeat. While Emilia has a white and purple
                cloak like clothes.</strong>  Some people think Emilia and Satella are the 
                same person, are they? No. They are diffrent people tho looking the same
                The Witch of Envy is <strong>not</strong> Satella. We also see that Satella 
                seems to have a intrest in Subaru, as she says she likes him "giving her light, 
                showing her the outside world, holding her hand when she was lonely, 
                and kissing her when she was all alone," Yes they kissed in <a href='https://vrv.co/watch/G6XM74EER/ReZERO-Starting-Life-in-Another-World-:The-Taste-of-Death'>season 2 episode 36</a>
